# ruby Sinatra Albums

Welcome to this Ruby Album/User database project! Here you can create/edit your own profile and create/edit your own albums! You can even view other users and their albums.

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/Sinatra-Final-Project`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.
